This is a simple chatbot implemented in Python using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.
The chatbot uses predefined patterns and responses to interact with users in a conversational manner.
It's a great example of how to build a rule-based chatbot using NLTK's powerful tools.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for implementing the chatbot.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A Python library used for text processing, such as tokenization, stemming, and pattern matching.

How It Works : 
The chatbot uses regular expressions and tokenization to match the user input to predefined patterns. The NLTK library's nltk.chat.util module provides tools that allow us to easily create conversational patterns and responses.

Basic Steps:
Input Processing: The chatbot processes the user input by tokenizing the sentence and matching it against a list of predefined patterns. These patterns are regular expressions that capture common ways a user might phrase a question or statement.

Pattern Matching: The chatbot uses a simple matching system to find the best response. Each pattern has an associated response, and the bot picks the most relevant one.

Response Generation: Once the user input is matched to a pattern, the bot replies with the corresponding response, which can be a simple text string or a more complex interaction.
